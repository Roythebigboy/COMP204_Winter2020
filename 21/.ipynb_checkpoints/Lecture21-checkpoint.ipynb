    "\n",
    "For example, say we want to explore a dataset stored in a *comma separated value (CSV)* table on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? \n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To some extent, it is a like programming version of the Microsoft Excel and a lot more\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib (Lecture 22). Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Not only is the pandas library a central component of the data science toolkit but it is used in conjunction with other libraries in that collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of the **NumPy** package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in **SciPy**, plotting functions from **Matplotlib** (Lecture 22), and machine learning algorithms in **Scikit-learn** (Later Lectures).\n",

    "\n",
    "## When should you start using pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have any experience coding in Python, then you should stay away from learning pandas until you do. You don’t have to be at the level of the software engineer, but you should be adept at the basics, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, and iterations. Also, I’d also recommend familiarizing yourself with **NumPy** due to the similarities mentioned above.\n",

    "Moreover, for those of you looking to do a [data science bootcamp](https://www.learndatasci.com/articles/thinkful-data-science-online-bootcamp-review/) or some other accelerated data science education program, it's highly recommended you start learning pandas on your own before you start the program. \n",
